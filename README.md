## Assignment 3 - web scraping DataCamp

Create a long data frame by scraping the names of all DataCamps courses in R & Python:


https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:r

https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/tech:python


Your final data frame should have two variables, one for “tech” and one for “language”.

## Assignment 4 - web scraping timeplan

Create a data frame by scraping our calendar in BED-2056:


http://timeplan.uit.no/emne_timeplan.php?sem=20h&module%5B%5D=BED-2056-1&View=list


This is the link to the “Vis” list. If you would like to scrape another “Vis”, that is ok. In the final data frame, each date should be one row, and make sure you format the dates correctly.

## Assignment 5 - SSB API

Finish the code we were working on in our latest session:

Recode the variable “region” into tidy names, and make a single plot of “roomcap” for all counties, over time, including the “Whole_country”.
